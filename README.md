- This project is an attempt to communicate with deaf and dumb people who are only able to communicate with sign language.
- People who arenâ€™t familiar with sign languages will be able to understand what these people mean with the respective signs.
- The sign language is translated to text by means of an algorithm making it simpler to comprehend.
